# MetalurgIA Software

This is an Open Source Software focus on Metallurgical applications, the object is to make a web app that can make very useful analysis, balances, simulations and reports for free no dependence from a desktop app.

## Usage
You can use the app in this link from Streamlit App [link](https://software-metalurgia-demo.streamlit.app/).

## How to run localy
If you want to contribute to this project, you need to follow this step:
- Download and install **anaconda**, you know more about this [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download)..
- Clone this repository and create a virtual env to install the libraries in `requirements.txt`.
- Activate the environment and use the command `streamlit run Hello.py`.
> **Important: ensure that you run the command without ./ In front of the archive name**, this could cause an error in the application.

## How to Contribute
Actually the project is focused on creating the most useful tools to metallurgical and process engineers, so the functionalities like mass balances for flotation and grinding circuts need to be complete.

If you want to contribute, please take a look of the pages have already constructed before.

A simple guide to add a new tool:
* Create the *User Interface* for the app in the `.\pages` folder using streamlit. 
* Create the various calculus, dataframes and tools for this app in `.\utilities` folder, for making the app more maintainable.
