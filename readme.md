> __Important: ensure that you run the comand whitout ./ in front of the archive name__, this could cause and error in the application. 

## How to Contribute
Acctually the project is focus on create the most useful tools to metallurgical and process engineers, so the funcionalities like mass balances ins flotation and grinding need to be complete.

If you want to contribute please take a look of the pages already construct before. 

A simple guide for add an new tool:
* Create the 'User Interface' for the app in the `pages` folder using streamlit. 
* Create the varius calculus, dataframes and tools for this app in `utilites` folder, for made the app more mantainable.
